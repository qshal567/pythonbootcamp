# Explanation for a 4-year-old:

# Imagine you have a magical piggy bank called a "BankAccount." It starts with no money inside.

# Your magical piggy bank has a special number (8-digit account number) to recognize it from others.

# To put money in, you use the "deposit" button. If you put $5, it adds $5 to your piggy bank.

# To take money out, you use the "withdraw" button. If you want to take $3 but you only have $2, it will tell you, "You don't have enough money."

# You can also ask your piggy bank how much money is inside. It will tell you.

# If you want to know its special number, it will also tell you.

# This is like your own special piggy bank, and you can put money in, take money out, check how much is in there, and know its special number.
